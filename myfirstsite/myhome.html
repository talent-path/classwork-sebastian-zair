    <!-- So what do we need in our header?
    The header defines the metadata
    ie. defines information ABOUT the page
    AKA "metadata"

        not every tag (such as meta) needs a closing tag

    "viewport" arranges the size of a screen based on the device using it
       - most web traffic is in 

       There's a boiler plate you can auto generate for these default things in the header

-->
    <head>

        <meta charset="UTF-8" >
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

        <title> My First Site! </title>
        
    </head>
    <body>
<!-- 
    The 2 main lay out optinos for tags are either 'block level' or 'in-line'

    Block level elements = (divs, tables, etc) affect the layout by..
    .. these take up the full width of a window
    Block level is not inline because inline elements remain within the current line they are on
    Block elements CREATE A NEW LINE
    Inline level elements = (span)

-->
this text comes before the paragraph
<p>
    Paragraph tags are block elements 
    <!-- spacing doesnt matter with those text. It'll always be the same unless explicitly told to do so-->

</p>
this comes after the paragraph
<!-- inline level elements examples. They'll stay on the current line..-->
This is text before span. 
<span> this text comes after the span</span>

<!-- banners and logos go in the <header> tags
    links for other websites and such go in the <footer> 
        Both are inline elements
    <div> stands for division and they're one of the most common tags for grouping chunks of elements together
        You can see nested divs often
    <div style="display" 
<hq> is a semantic tag..(?)
    <h1-6> Has the size of your headers be different names
        a div is a "container" for tags that orchestrates dimensions and stuff
<ul></ul> is an unordered list (meaning it shows dots for each element)
   - how do we add to the list? (li tag (list item))
   <ul> 
       <li> this is the first item <li>
           <li> This is the 2nd item> </ul>

<ol> is an ordered list which we will still use "li" for
<a>  (anchor tag) puts links into your texts. Links such as URLs and Images
    - we use the href attrivute to decide where to go
<a href="google.com">click this link to access Google! :D </a>
    - what if we wanted to have an image become a link what do we do?
    <br></br>  - to put the 2 links on separate lies
<a href="google.com" style="display: block; margin:50x;"> <
    img src="link for image">
   alt="The main Google logo"
</a>

SELECTS:
<select> this tag is used to create dropdowns
    - choices in your drowndown menu are represented through your options tag
    when we choose options we are selecting their VALUE
      and NOT their TEXT
<select>
    <option> value="1"> Chihuahua></option>
    <option value="2"> Terrier </option>

-       - what do we do when we need multiple styles of text?
<input>
<textarea>
    You could put multiple lines of text in this
</textarea>

<input> this tag represents many different source of inputs
      - the deafault is text input
      - define the type of input you want in your input

<input type="text"> This is my default input text </input> (optional closing input tag)
<input type="text" placehodler="The text the user sees before they type">
<input type="date" placeholder="the data is in here">
<input type="datetime"> (if you want the date AND time of something)
<input type="email"> (if you want validation for an email in there)
<input type="hidden" (used for holding an ID information that we make sure a user provides)
<input type="password" (gives you the lil PW box where no one can see the characters being typed in)
<input type="number" min="0" max="100" (gives a number counter it seems)
<input type="checkbox" checked> (will start it off as marked meaning you won't need to assign it anything)
<input type="radio" > (Used for choosing 1 of MANY options)

<span> Option A: </span><input id="option1" value="1" name="dogType" type="radio"<br>
    - When you use multiple radios which you likely will, you have to have the same 'name'
    - names and values are the important thing to take away from this

<input type="color">
<input type="button" value="click me!" onclick="alert('you clicked the button');"

<button onclick="alert(you've clicked the other button)'"> For this tag the button text goes here</button>
JavaSCRIPT goes in the BOTTOM of the <body> tag..


<script type="text/javascript" src="home.js"></script>
 - when should your script be in a separate page rather than a while"
 - how do we look up a div for later?
 <div id="toggletext"
